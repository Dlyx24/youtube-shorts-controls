# Youtube Shorts Controls

Adds controls to youtube shorts videos.

# Motivation
I don't usually see many shorts, but when I do see them I find that sometimes I need to go back a couple of seconds to re-watch something. Well Youtube shorts don't offer you the controls to do this and you effectively need to watch the whole video again...
And so I started creating a Tampermonkey script to edit the shorts page so that I can control any short like a normal video.

# Usage 
Feel free to copy the script into your Tampermonkey and use/edit it as you will. 
I am working on a firefox extension so that people that don't have Tampermonkey can use it as well.
